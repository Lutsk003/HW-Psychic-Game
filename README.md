This is a simple Javascript application that randomly chooses a letter for the player to guess.

The app keeps track of how many times the player guesses correctly, incorrectly, the number of guesses the have left, and also displays the incorrect letters that they have guessed so far.

Every time the player wins or loses the game, the respective counter is updated and the game starts over.
